        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>We're Imen Ben Khraief and Line Chouchane, two 19-year-old engineering students from Sousse, Tunisia, currently in our second year studying CIT at Ecole Polytechnique de Sousse. We met last year as classmates, and what started as a simple friendship quickly turned into a shared passion for adventure and exploration.</p>
        
        <p>Our travel journey began with a spontaneous trip to Monastir. Neither of us knew the city well, and we got lost—twice! But instead of panicking, we embraced the chaos, found our way out, and discovered that getting lost can be the best part of the adventure. That day taught us that travel isn't just about the destination; it's about the experiences, the challenges, and the memories you create along the way.</p>
        
        <p>As tech students, we believe in balancing our studies with exploration. Traveling helps us earn new skills, unlock our potential, and recharge our creativity—all while having fun and discovering amazing food! What makes us different? We started traveling alone at 18, young and fearless, always ready to try new things and step out of our comfort zone.</p>

    <section class="our-story reveal">
        <h2>Our Journey Through Tunisia</h2>
        <p>Tunisia has been our training ground for adventure. Line has explored the enchanting island of Djerba, ventured into the desert landscapes of Tozeur and Douz, discovered the lush forests of Ain Draham, and traveled through the historic south including Tataouine. She's also visited the spiritual city of Kairouan, the mountain springs of Zaghouan, and the coastal beauty of Mehdia.</p>
        
        <p>Imen's journey has taken her from the capital city of Tunis to the northern coastal charm of Bizerte, through Mehdia's beaches, across the desert oasis of Tozeur, up to Zaghouan's heights, and of course, Sousse—where she now studies but originally calls Kairouan home. Together, we've explored Monastir (where we famously got lost!) and attended a congress in Hammamet, mixing professional growth with adventure.</p>
        
        <p>Through all these experiences, we've learned invaluable lessons: independence, problem-solving under pressure, adaptability, and the confidence that comes from navigating the unknown. We've discovered that every wrong turn leads to an unexpected discovery, that locals always have the best recommendations, and that the best stories come from moments when we have to figure things out ourselves.</p>
        
        <p>Our favorite memories? They're always the ones where we had to depend entirely on ourselves—getting lost even with internet and GPS, stumbling upon hidden gems that aren't in any guidebook, and turning potential disasters into unforgettable adventures. These moments taught us more than any textbook ever could.</p>

        <h2>Why We Travel & What We Share</h2>
        <p>Our mission is simple: to inspire you to step out of your comfort zone and discover the world around you. Through this blog, we share the best places to visit, from popular attractions to hidden gems that most tourists never find. We'll guide you with honest food recommendations, realistic budgets for each destination, and practical tips that come from real experiences—not just research.</p>
        <p>But more than just travel tips, we want to help you find the courage to try new things. Travel isn't just about visiting places; it's about breaking free from your daily routine, experiencing different cultures, tasting new foods, and making friends from all corners of the world. It's about saying "yes" to adventures that scare you a little and discovering that you're capable of more than you thought.</p>
        <div class="travel-philosophy">
            <h3>Our Travel Philosophy</h3>
            <p><em>"Get lost, find yourself, and make every wrong turn count."</em></p>
            <p>We believe that the best travel experiences come from embracing the unexpected, trusting your instincts, and being open to adventures that aren't in the guidebook. Whether you're traveling on a student budget or splurging on a dream trip, what matters most is the courage to start, the willingness to explore, and the memories you create along the way.</p>
